Description: A simplified, efficient, interface to MPI for HPC clusters. It is
        a derivation and rethinking of the Rmpi package. pbdMPI embraces the
        prevalent parallel programming style on HPC clusters. Beyond the
        interface, a collection of functions for global work with
        distributed data and resource-independent RNG reproducibility is
        included. It is based on S4 classes and methods. 
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Linux, Mac, and FreeBSD.
        MS-MPI (Microsoft MPI v7.1 (SDK) and Microsoft HPC Pack 2012 R2
        MS-MPI Redistributable Package) on Windows.
